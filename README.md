# Labs-Compilers

## Programming Assignment 1

### Task
For this assignment, you are to write a lexical analyzer, also called a scanner, using a lexical analyzer
generator. (The C++ tool is called flex; the Java tool is called jlex.) You will describe the set of tokens
for Cool in an appropriate input format, and the analyzer generator will generate the actual code (C++
or Java) for recognizing tokens in Cool programs.

** WARNING. The cool.flex constants are heavily interrelated with cool-parse.h **
